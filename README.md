Moved from private development to public development after an half year.
This was only a project on my own to learn how extern classes works and how to develop a extensible system.
So this is not in any way a professional code but a beginning ;)

Have FUN with this.

### Who has written this awesome code? :D ###

It's me, Alf21

### What is this repository for? ###

This Plugin is for SAMP (Shoebill Plugin) and it is written in Java.

You can add / extense the Plugin with own events but need to recompile.

Currently there is one Event 'Catching' so you need to hunt a player.
(Catching is full implemented)

Version 0.2d

### How do I get set up? ###

Put Plugin into Shoebill/plugins and add it to resources.yml

### Who do I talk to? ###
